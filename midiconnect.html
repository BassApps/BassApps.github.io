  <p>    The first thing you will need to make sure is that both your smartphone and your computer/laptop are in the same network. <br> Example: Your phone is connected to your router via WiFi(WLAN) and your PC/Mac is connected to your router via LAN or WiFi(WLAN). <br>
  After launching the app on your phone, select your OS (Windows or macOS) below.</p>

			You need to download and install an additional driver available at 
			<a href="http://www.humatic.de/htools/mnet/download.php" target="_blank">humatic.de</a>

			 Step 1: <br>
			After installing MIDIHub, launch it. Check whether your phone's showing is on the left. If not, reboot your PC.
			 <br> <br>
			 
			 Step 2: <br>
			Check if another application is already accessing MIDIHub. If the upper-right text says "Loaded by MIDIHub" or the application
			you wanna use it with, you can continue with Step 3. If it mentions any other software hit the triangular
			exclamation point warning sign thingy right next to it and add the .exe you don't want as an exception. You might have
			to repeat this until you get "Loaded by MIDIHub" or Traktor, Ableton, Maschine, ...
			 <br> <br>
			 
			  Step 3: <br>
			Drag and drop a virtual cable from the port symbol on the tile of the phone to "Port 1" on the right.
			Remember the port name you picked and close the software. <br>
